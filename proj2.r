## Group contribution:
# Overall, the weights of contribution for each group member are fairly equal. 
# We wrote our own coding based on our personal understanding of these questions. 
# We shared our ideas when anyone stick in somewhere and all of us enjoyed the teamwork. 
# The final version upload now is the final work we all committed for.

## Project introduction:
# In this project, we used stochastic simulation to investigate a somewhat surprising 
# probability puzzle, which is also known as the classic 2n prisoners problem. 
# Here we conducted this investigation under three strategies and compared the 
# corresponding probabilities derived to find if there are surprising results.
# After estimating the probabilities of going free (finding their numbers), 
# our next step, which is also the core of our investigation, would be estimating 
# the probability distribution of the number of steps needed to go free.

# The set up of this puzzle is basically as follows: 
# 2n prisoners each with unique numbers from 1 to 2n
# 2n boxes each with unique numbers from 1 to 2n painted on its lid
# 2n cards each printed with a unique number from 1 to 2n, are randomly placed one in each box
# Prisoners have the task of finding the card with their number on it by opening a maximum on n boxes.

# The three strategies are:
# 1) The prisoner starts at the box with their number on it, opens it and reads the number on 
# the card: k, say. If k is not their prisoner number, they go to box number k, open it and repeat 
# the process until they have either found the card with their number on it, or opened n boxes without 
# finding it.
# 2) As strategy 1, but starting from a randomly selected box.
# 3) Prisoners open n boxes at random, checking each card for their number.

# Under the three strategies, 
# We first estimated the probabilities of success (going free) for a single prisoner. 
# Then, we estimated the probabilities for all prisoners to succeed so that they are freed.

# Finally, we estimated a probability distribution of the number of times (from 1 to 2n) needed for 
# a prisoner to succeed (find her/his card). Based on this, we can better understand the surprising result.

############################# surprising results ###############################

# From the results obtained from function "Pone", the estimated probabilities of 
# a single prisoner succeeding in finding their number under three strategies converges 
# to 0.5, 0.4, 0.5 respectively. However, the results from function "Pall" shows that 
# the estimated probabilities of all prisoners finding their numbers are relatively different 
# under these three strategies. Surprisingly, the estimated probability for all prisoner being 
# released is over 30% under strategy 1, which is unexpectedly high compared with the results 
# under another two strategies. Under strategy 3, the result is nearly 0.

# The most possible reason why the prisoners have such high probability to escape under 
# strategy 1 is the prisoners don't have to decide which box he/she opens first, 
# that is, there are more constraints under strategy 1. Another important point is that 
# the success of one prisoner is not independent of the success of the other prisoners in 
# this way, since they all depend on the way the numbers are distributed.
